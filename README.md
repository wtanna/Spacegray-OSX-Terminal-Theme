### Spacegray Theme For Mac Terminal

Once Yosemite came out I found that the stuff I used in iTerm2 was now in the standard terminal so I switched back! But I missed my favorite theme from iTerm2 so I created it for Mac terminal!

#### Setup:

Launch Terminal

In the top menu bar click Terminal -> Preferences (or ⌘,)

Go to "Profiles"

Click the Gear symbol

Click Import...

Click spacegray.terminal and press Open

Now set the profile as "Default" and you should be good!

##### Settings:

##### Extra Info:
I am using a downloaded font called Droid Sans Mono

I am also using oh-my-zsh for zsh instead of the default shell
